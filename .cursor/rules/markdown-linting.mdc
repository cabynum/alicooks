# Markdown Linting Rules

## Mandatory Linting Check

After writing or editing ANY markdown file (`.md`):

1. Call `read_lints` on the specific file path
2. If errors are found, fix them before proceeding
3. Re-run `read_lints` to verify the fix
4. Do NOT proceed to other tasks until linting passes with zero errors

**Known Issue**: The linter may not catch errors on the first check due to timing.
If the user reports a linting error that wasn't caught, apologize and fix it immediately.

**Prevention**: When writing markdown files, ensure:
- No trailing blank lines at end of file
- Exactly one newline at end of file (no more, no less)

## Line Length (MD013)

**Configured in `.markdownlint.json`**: 120 characters max (relaxed from default 80)

- Tables are exempt from line length checks (they often need more room)
- This balances readability with practical prose writing

## Common Issues to Avoid

- Multiple consecutive blank lines (MD012)
- Missing blank lines around headings (MD022)
- Missing blank lines around lists (MD032)
- Missing blank lines around code fences (MD031)
- Trailing whitespace (MD009)
- Missing language tags on code blocks (MD040)
- **Bold text alone on a line used as heading (MD036)** — use actual `#` headings instead

## Formatting Preferences

### Line Breaks (Preferred over Tables)

For metadata or key-value pairs that need to appear on separate lines, use **two
trailing spaces** instead of tables:

```markdown
**Feature Branch**: `001-meal-planner`  
**Created**: 2024-12-15  
**Status**: Draft  
```

(Each line ends with two spaces to force a line break)

**Use actual tables only when**:
- Data has multiple columns that benefit from alignment
- Comparing items side-by-side
- The content is truly tabular in nature

When a table is the better choice, explicitly recommend it to the user.

## Why This Matters

Per the AliCooks Constitution (Quality Standards): Documentation MUST be written
for a reader unfamiliar with the codebase. Clean, consistent markdown ensures
readability and professionalism.
