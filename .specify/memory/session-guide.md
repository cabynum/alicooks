### Notes

- Use two trailing spaces for line breaks (not tables) unless truly tabular
- All markdown files must pass linting before merge
- **Update `blog/` when significant progress is made** — capture decisions in real-time
- Entity naming: **Dish** (individual item) → **Meal** (combination) → **MealPlan** (schedule)
